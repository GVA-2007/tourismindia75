<p>Amritsar â€“ The Golden city of Punjab Founded in the fifteenth century by Guru Ram Das, the fourth guru of the Sikhs. 
The heritage city of Amritsar is one of the most spiritually significant and historically rich cities of India. 
The name of the city has its etymological roots in the Punjabi language and Amritsar comes from Amrit Sarovar, which when literally translated from Punjab means of pool of nectar. 
One of the largest cities in Punjab. <br><br>
Amritsar is home to India's most serene and humbling sight, the Harimandar Sahib, famously knows as The Golden Temple, the Place of reverence for pilgrims. 
Amritsar boasts of various temples and shrines dedicated to Sikh Culture. 
Besides offering spiritual salvation, the city is also famous for hospitality, tourism, carpets, handloom fabrics and handicrafts. 
Amritsar does not merely give nourishment to the soul, but also serves mouth-watering delicious authentic Punjabi food steeped in rich tradition. <br><br>
So come, visit & discover this grand city, with its resplendent places of worship, quirky bazaars, vibrant theatrical practices, fascinating folklore and colourful festivals of Baisakhi and Diwali; all of which make Amritsar a premier destination for tourists.
The buildings of the Golden Temple complex, particularly the Akal Takht, sustained damage in June 1984 during Operation Blue Star, an Indian army attack to dislodge Sikh separatists from the site. 
The military operation, ordered by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was a reaction to the occupation of the Akal Takht in 1982 by a young Sikh fundamentalist, Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, and his armed followers who sought the creation of an independent Sikh-majority country called Khalistan.</p>
