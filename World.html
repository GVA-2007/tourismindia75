The World Heritage Convention ensures global commitment for the conservation of these exceptional places, while respecting their cultural and local connections.<br><br>

The World Heritage Convention recognises some World Heritage properties specifically for their outstanding biodiversity values, protecting many of the most important ecosystems and areas of high biodiversity on the planet, as follows:</p>

<h3 style="font-size:30px; margin-left:50px; color: #007aa5;">Why Safe Guard Heritage ?</h3>
<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 80px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;">UNESCO works to safeguard heritage so that future generations can enjoy, benefit and learn
from the legacy of the past. In addition to its intrinsic value, heritage can be a driver of
sustainable development and local job creation. Conserving the world’s natural heritage is also
essential for the health of the planet and plays a key role in addressing the risk of natural and
human-made disasters. Finally, safeguarding heritage brings countries and communities together,
uniting people of different backgrounds around a common belief in the value of our history and
environment. This is particularly crucial in times of emergency, when the safeguarding, continuation or
rehabilitation of heritage provides an invaluable source of stability and hope for affected communities.
Given the immense value of heritage for present and future generations, countering the growing threats it
faces has never been more important. </p>

<h3 style="font-size:30px; margin-left:50px; color: #007aa5;">HOW DOES UNESCO WORK TO SAFEGUARD HERITAGE ?</h3>

<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 80px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;"><b>1. Encouraging safeguarding through its normative tools.</b> Five UNESCO Conventions underlie its efforts to
safeguard heritage: the 2003 Intangible Cultural Heritage Convention, the 2001 Underwater Heritage
Convention, the 1972 World Heritage Convention, the 1970 Convention on Preventing the Illicit Trafficking
of Cultural Property and the 1954 Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed
Conflict and its two (1954 and 1999) Protocols.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 80px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;"><b>2. Leading emergency safeguarding efforts.</b> In Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, Brazil, Mali, Peru, Afghanistan, Haiti,
Nepal, Bosnia and elsewhere, UNESCO has consistently led international efforts to safeguard heritage in
crisis. Following the 4 August 2020 explosions in Beirut, UNESCO launched the Li Beirut (“For Beirut”)
initiative, which aims to reconstruct and recover Beirut’s cultural heritage and cultural life. UNESCO’s flagship initiative to “Revive the Spirit of Mosul” seeks to restore and reconstruct Mosul’s cultural and
educational institutions. Days after the devastating fire at the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro,
which destroyed an estimated 80-90% of the museum's 20 million-piece collection, UNESCO sent an
emergency mission to the site to support the preparation of an Action Plan for the museum’s recovery.
UNESCO encouraged the adoption of the first UN Security Council Resolution to focus on the protection of
cultural heritage in March 2017, and has since led the elaboration of the UN Secretary General’s report on
its implementation by Member States.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 80px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;"><b>3. Monitoring heritage in the face of global challenges.</b> Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, UNESCO has
monitored World Heritage site closures through an online map; during the height of the crisis, 89% of World
Heritage properties were closed or partially closed. UNESCO has also launched a web platform of living
heritage experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. UNESCO monitors the impact of climate change on
cultural heritage and is in the process of updating its Policy Document on the impacts of Climate Change
on World Heritage</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 80px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;"><b>4. Promoting reconciliation through heritage safeguarding.</b> Traditional Korean wrestling was inscribed on
the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity following a historic joint nomination
by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea – a highly symbolic step towards
inter-Korean reconciliation. UNESCO and Colombia recently launched an innovative project to integrate excombatants of the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC-EP) in the territory of Pondores and to restore social
links with host communities through living heritage, in support of the 2016 Peace Agreement.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 80px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;"><b>5. Strengthening the links between heritage and education.</b> Through the World Heritage Education
Programme, more than 3,500 young volunteers have learned about the value of heritage by taking part in
359 youth camps in 61 countries. The 2003 Convention, in cooperation with UNESCO’s Education Sector,
has launch a series of projects aimed at integrating intangible cultural heritage into both formal and
informal education, in line with SDG 4.7. Young people from 17 countries in the Arab States region
participated in the Arab World Heritage Young Professionals Forum, held in Tunis in December 2019. These
young professionals focused on the links between peacebuilding and the protection, preservation and
promotion of World Heritage.
</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 80px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;"><b>6. Prioritising cities.</b> UNESCO has kick-started a project on the role of living heritage in cities, which will
support community-based inventories of intangible cultural heritage in nine pilot cities around the world.
In line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and UNESCO’s 2011 Recommendation on the
Historic Urban Landscape, UNESCO published the Global Report on Culture for Sustainable Urban
Development, Culture: Urban Future, which aims to promote a culture-based approach to urban planning,
regeneration and development. UNESCO and the World Bank have jointly launched a Position Paper on
“Culture in City Reconstruction and Recovery”, which proposes a new framework for integrating culture
into city reconstruction and recovery following conflict, natural disasters or crises.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px; margin-left: 80px; line-height: 30px; text-align: justify;"><b>7. Building stakeholder capacity.</b> In February 2018, UNESCO announced the launch of a three-year project
co-financed by the African Development Bank to safeguard the Lake Chad Basin. The project will aim to
implement pilot projects to rehabilitate Lake Chad's ecosystems and cultural landscapes, as well as develop
a road map for the nomination of the Lake Chad Basin to the World Heritage List.
The 2003 Convention’s global capacity-building programme works to create positive institutional
environments for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage, while the UNESCO Chair Programme on Cultural
Heritage and Risk Management supports training courses on disaster risk management.</p>
