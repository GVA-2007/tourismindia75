<hr>
<p>Ujjain, a city located in the state of Madhya Pradesh, is a divine land that offers a unique blend of solitude and spiritual experiences.
This temple town is renowned for hosting one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, Simhastha (Kumbh Mela), which occurs every 12 years on the banks of the Shipra river.
Also known as the temple town of Madhya Pradesh, the city is home to more than 100 temples and numerous pilgrimage sites of different eras.
The biggest attraction of Ujjain is the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga Temple.<br><br>
It is one of the 12 jyotirlingas, where Bhasma aarti is a daily ritual that you must not miss and this is what Ujjain is famous for.
The process begins with the 'Abhishek' or the ritual bath of the shivling then smearing it with multiple offerings like curd, honey, sandal paste and finally cleaning it with milk and water.<br><br>
Finally, the Shiva linga is decorated with ash and shringaar material.
According to ancient legends, the foundation of the temple was laid by the Lord Brahma (God of Creation).
It was considered by historians that there was no Shikhara on the top of the temple till Gupta period.
However, later on, a shikhara was constructed and it enhanced the beauty of the temple.
Ujjain can be explored anytime in the year.
However, the best time to visit Ujjain is during festivals like Mahashivratri, Mondays of Savan month, Nag Panchami and especially during Kartik Mela (yearly) and Kumbh Mela (once in 12 years).</p>
